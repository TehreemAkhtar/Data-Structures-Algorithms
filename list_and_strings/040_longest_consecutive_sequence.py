# Sort solution

# Time Complexity (TC): O(n log n):
# Space Complexity (SC): O(n) or O(1): Depends on sorting algo
# Approach: sort the entire array and start the counting the sequence -> skip duplicates ->
# reset the count for new sequence

# Hash set solution

# Time Complexity (TC): O(n): the entire sequence is traversed once across the whole algorithm, not once per element.
# Though the solution may look like quadratic due to the while loop inside the for loop, the while loop only gets
# executed at the start of a sequence when (n-1) is not found in the set. Worst case for a sorted array,
# the first pass will run the while loop (n-1) times, but all other run it will not get executed at all.
# so the while loop will only run a total of n times for the entire length of the solution.
# so the complexity is O(n+n) which is O(n)..

# Space Complexity (SC): O(n): We can avoid this by directly updating input array to a set
# Approach: Convert to set for faster lookups and avoid duplicates -> only start counting the sequence if
# no left neighbour is found -> iterate over the whole sequence until a new sequence is found ->
# update the streak for whatever the max streak is
