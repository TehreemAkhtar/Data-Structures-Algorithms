# Solution # 1
# Time Complexity (TC): O(n log n): Python uses Tim sort which takes n log n time
# Space Complexity (SC): O(n): Strings in Python are immutable. Therefore, when you sorted(s)
# Approach: Converts s into a list of characters -> Sorts that list -> Returns a new sorted list
# Even though it feels like you're not explicitly creating anything, under the hood,
# a copy of all elements is created. As a string can't be sorted in-place.
def is_anagram_1(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    return False if len(s) != len(t) else sorted(s) == sorted(t)


# Solution # 2
# Time Complexity (TC): O(n): sort + traversing the array
# Space Complexity (SC): Assuming only alphabets are considered = O(1): since we have at most 26 different characters.
# BUT if unicode chars are included; which are 150k+ then SC will be O(n)
# Approach: Count frequency of each char in two dicts and compare them
def is_anagram_2(s, t: str) -> bool:

        count_t[t[i]] = 1 + count_t.get(t[i], 0)
    return count_s == count_t


# Solution # 3
# Optimisation - using only 1 hashmap
# Time Complexity (TC): O(n): sort + traversing the array
# Space Complexity (SC): O(1) or O(n) depending on input
# Approach: use a single dict count to increment for s[i] and decrement for t[i]. So by the end of the loop:
# If s and t are true anagrams, every characterâ€™s count will be 0.

# Solution # 5
# Optimisation of Sol #3- using a list instead of a dict
# Limitation: will break if input contains anything other than a-z letters.
