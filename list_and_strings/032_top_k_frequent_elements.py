# Time Complexity (TC): O(n + m.log.m) = O(nlgn) if there are n unique elements i.e. m = n
# Space Complexity (SC): O(m) or O(n) if m = n
# Approach: Use hashmap to count frequencies -> sort the hashmap based on values (frequencies) ->
# return the top k keys (indexes)

# Time Complexity (TC): O(n)
# Space Complexity (SC): O(n)
# Approach: Bucket sort -> items in buckets indexed by frequency â†’ scan buckets in reverse â†’ pick top K.
# Each index in freq represents the frequency and each element at freq[i] contains a bucket of numbers
# having that frequency.

# Optimisation: Can keep track of max while creating count -> then use it to specify size of
# freq instead of using len(nums)


# Time Complexity (TC): O(nlogk) where k is the size of heap
# Space Complexity (SC): O(n + k) where k is the size of frequent elements
# Approach: Bucket sort -> items in buckets indexed by frequency â†’ scan buckets in reverse â†’ pick top K.
# Each index in freq represents the frequency and each element at freq[i] contains a bucket of numbers
# having that frequency.

# Time complexity breakdown:
# Min Heap idea
# 	â€¢	Keep a Min Heap that never grows bigger than K:
# 	â€¢	For each unique number: Push it in heap -> If heap size exceeds K, pop the smallest immediately.
# 	â€¢	So at all times, heap size is at most K.
# 	After seeing all elements: (while creating res list)
# 	â€¢	You pop K times â†’ each pop is log K.
# 	For each of the N numbers:
# 	â€¢	Push = log K (because heap is k)
# 	â€¢	Possibly pop = log K
# 	â€¢	So visiting all N = O(N log K)
# 	â€¢   Final pops = O(K log K) but K is small
# ðŸ‘‰ So Total: O(N log K)

# Why we didn't use max-heap?
# Max Heap always works with the big heap (size N).
# Max Heap pops cost log(N) each
# And N is usually way bigger than K, so Min Heap is faster.
